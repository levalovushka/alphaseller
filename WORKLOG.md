# Worklog

## 2026-09-02 — md style to 18/24 Regular, squircle logo, first commit

**What changed.** `assets/css/base.css`: style `md` is now Hyper Regular 18/24 (was Medium
22/28), tracking unchanged at 1%; weights moved into `--weight-xl` / `--weight-md` tokens.
The logo square is a squircle — `border-radius` as the fallback, `corner-shape: squircle`
inside `@supports` for Chrome 139+. `CONTEXT.md` updated to match.

**Why.** Client decisions.

**How it was verified.** Live DOM at 1440×900 over the local server: title
`500 / 87% / 44px / 44px`, body `400 / 87% / 18px / 24px / 0.18px`, logo box 52×52 with
computed `corner-shape: squircle` and `border-radius: 14px`, no horizontal overflow.

**Left undone.** Still no JS: no navbar ink switching, no GSAP. Frames empty. Corner radius
value, the square's fill, the mark size inside it and the header height are still
placeholders.

## 2026-09-02 — typography, logo lockup, control heights

**What changed.** `assets/css/base.css`: replaced the placeholder type scale with the
client's two styles — `xl` (Hyper Medium 44/44, titles) and `md` (Hyper Medium 22/28, 1%
tracking, everything else); both map to `font-stretch: 87%; font-weight: 500`. Buttons are
now height-driven: 52 in the header, 44 under subtitles. `index.html`: the header logo is
the mark only, in a 52×52 rounded square; trailing periods removed from all 7 subtitles.
`CONTEXT.md` updated to match.

**Why.** The client fixed the type system and the control sizes.

**How it was verified.** Measured the live DOM at 1440×900 over the local server:
title `500 / 87% / 44px / 44px`, body and nav `500 / 87% / 22px / 28px / 0.22px` tracking,
logo box 52×52, header button 52 high, section button 44 high, subtitles ending in "." — 0,
no horizontal overflow.

**Left undone.** Still no JS: no navbar ink switching, no GSAP. Frames still empty. Logo
square radius, its fill, the mark size inside it and the header height are placeholders
awaiting the client. Nothing committed or pushed.

## 2026-09-02 — project setup, context file, structural markup

**What changed.** Cloned the empty repo. Vendored assets: `assets/fonts/` (YFF RARE VF —
woff2 built from the TTF, plus the source TTF and the static PowerBlack cut),
`assets/logo/` (full lockup + mark, clean vectors from Figma `196:46920`),
`assets/screens/` (4 product screens @2x from Figma `196:46923`), `assets/icons/`
(4 social icons from Figma `37:23880`). Wrote `CONTEXT.md` — the single source of truth for
the project. Wrote `index.html` (header, 7 sections, footer, all v1 copy) and
`assets/css/base.css` (structure and brand colors only). Added `.claude/launch.json` for
the local preview server and a `.gitignore` that excludes it.

**Why.** The client needs a desktop homepage demo to show the board. This step establishes
the shared context and the section skeleton before any visual design lands — the type
scale and the motion are still with the client.

**How it was verified.** Served over `python3 -m http.server 4321` and measured the live
DOM in the browser. At 1440×900: all 7 sections 1440×900 each, backgrounds
`#A6ED00 / #FFF / #E9EBEE / #000 / #E9EBEE / #FFF / #000`, footer `#000`, ink flips to
white on the black sections, `document.fonts.check('700 64px "YFF RARE"')` → `true`,
hero columns 277 / 662 / 277 px, no horizontal overflow. At 1920×1080: 436 / 760 / 436,
no overflow. Font axes and Cyrillic coverage checked with fontTools.

**Left undone.** No JS at all: the navbar ink switching and the per-section GSAP scroll
animation are not built. Frames are empty placeholders by the client's instruction. Type
scale is a placeholder (`--fs-title: 64px` etc.) pending his decision. Nothing committed or
pushed yet. Screenshots of the emulated 1440 viewport came back mis-scaled from the browser
pane, so the layout was verified by measurement rather than by eye.
